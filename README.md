### Object Stabilization in C
**Current idea:** Create a DIY arduino drone and program the control/stabilization logic in C

- CLI drone *simulator* shows basic thrust throttling logic controls, use ğŸ¡° ğŸ¡² ğŸ¡± ğŸ¡³
- Need to experiment with telemetry data from sensors to simulate realistic numbers for a stabilization algorithm
